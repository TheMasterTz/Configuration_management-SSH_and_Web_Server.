Specific port numbers are reserved to identify specific services so that an arriving packet can be easily forwarded to a running application.

Port numbers lower than 1024 identify the historically most commonly used services and are called the "well-known port numbers". 
Notable well-known port numbers:
20	File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Data Transfer
22	Secure Shell (SSH) Secure Login
80	Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used in the World Wide Web

The registered ports are those from 1024 through 49151. IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) maintains the official list of well-known and registered ranges. The dynamic or private ports are those from 49152 through 65535. One common use for this range is for ephemeral ports.
